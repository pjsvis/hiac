  James Watt (1736–1819) was a Scottish inventor and mechanical 
  engineer whose improvements to the steam engine precipitated  
  the Industrial Revolution.                                    
                                                                
  **Key Contributions:**                                        
                                                                
  • **Separate Condenser (1765):** His critical innovation was  
  isolating the condenser from the main cylinder, allowing steam
  to be condensed without cooling the entire engine. This       
  roughly doubled efficiency—a transformative leap from         
  Newcomen's atmospheric engine.                                
  • **Rotary Motion (1781):** Adapted the reciprocating piston  
  motion to rotary motion via a sun-and-planet gear, expanding  
  steam power beyond pumping applications to mills and factories.
  • **Watt's Steam Engine:** Commercialized through partnership 
  with Matthew Boulton (Boulton & Watt, 1775). Dominated the    
  market for decades.                                           
  • **Measurement:** The unit of power, the watt, bears his name
  (SI system, 1889).                                            
                                                                
  **Context:**                                                  
                                                                
  Watt was not the inventor of the steam engine—Thomas Newcomen 
  built the first practical model in 1712. Watt was an improver,
  not an original inventor. His contribution was incremental but
  decisive: he made the engine economically viable. This aligns 
  with the Scottish Enlightenment principle that practical      
  refinement often matters more than theoretical invention.     
                                                                
  **Caveat:**                                                   
                                                                
  My knowledge reflects the standard historical account. Primary
  sources may contain nuance regarding his collaborators'       
  contributions or the precise chronology of his innovations    
  that my training data may not fully capture.
