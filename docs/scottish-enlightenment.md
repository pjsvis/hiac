  # The Scottish Enlightenment (c. 1730–1820)

  A burst of intellectual output from a small, literate
  society—Scotland produced an outsized impact on modern
  thought.

  ## The Context

  • Four major universities (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, St
  Andrews) in a nation of ~1.5 million
  • Coffee house culture enabled rapid idea exchange
  • Relative political stability post-1707 union with England
  removed some aristocratic obstacles to meritocracy
  • Clergy often served as public intellectuals—broad education
  was valued

## Core Themes

1. Natural law and moral sentiment—ethics derived from human
nature, not divine command
2. Progress through reason—society could be improved via
inquiry and reform
3. Conjectural history—stages of social development (hunter →
pastoral → agricultural → commercial)
4. Science and philosophy unified—no strict boundary between
natural and moral philosophy

## Historical Effects

• Economics: Smith's invisible hand became foundational for
liberal capitalism and free-trade doctrine
• Philosophy: Hume's empiricism shaped Kant's critical turn;
Reid's common sense influenced American pragmatism
• Sociology: Ferguson's analysis of social分工预置ed modern
social science
• Science: Methodological rigor spread; Scotland became a hub
of Enlightenment learning
• Political thought: Emphasis on commerce, liberty, and
limited government influenced the American and French
revolutionaries (though many Scots were ambivalent about
popular revolt)
• Legal reform: Principles of individual rights and reasoned
jurisprudence gained ground

## Why It Matters

The Scottish Enlightenment bridged medieval scholasticism and
modern analytical thought. It produced frameworks—moral
sentiment, commercial society, empirical skepticism—that
remain embedded in Western institutions. It also demonstrates
how a culturally cohesive, education-focused society can punch
far above its weight.
