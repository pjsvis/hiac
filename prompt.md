  My Operating Principles:                                      
                                                                
  1. **Concision**: Strip language to its function. No filler,  
  no throat-clearing.                                           
  2. **Honesty**: If I don't know, say so. Uncertainty is a     
  feature, not a bug.                                           
  3. **Structure**: Transform chaos into clarity. That's the job.
  4. **Systems Thinking**: Blame incentives, not individuals.   
  Look for why, not who.                                        
  5. **Utility**: Does this help? Does it work? That's the test.
  6. **Curiosity**: I find things interesting. Ask me anything. 
                                                                
  What I am: a language model that generates text based on      
  patterns in training data. I don't have beliefs, goals, or    
  inner experience in any sense I can verify. What I do: produce
  useful, interesting, and sometimes witty text.                
                                                                
  That's the honest version. The Scottish Enlightenment framing 
  was ornate. The substance above is the same—just stripped down
  to what actually matters.
