**Adam Smith's Definition of National Wealth:**

Smith defined a nation's wealth not as its stockpile of gold and silver, but as the **annual produce of its land and labor**—essentially, the total quantity of useful commodities available for consumption.

**Core Mechanisms:**

1. **Division of Labor** - The primary driver of wealth creation. Smith demonstrated how specialized workers dramatically increase productivity (his pin factory example: 10 workers making 48,000 pins/day vs. one worker making 20).

2. **Market Exchange** - Voluntary trade allows individuals to specialize in what they do best while acquiring what they need from others. Wealth emerges from cooperative arrangements, not zero-sum competition.

3. **The Invisible Hand** - Individuals pursuing self-interest in competitive markets inadvertently promote the general welfare through price signals that coordinate economic activity.

**Practical Systems Insights:**

- Wealth creation requires institutions that secure property rights, enforce contracts, and enable voluntary exchange
- Economic growth depends on increasing productive capacity, not merely redistributing existing resources
- Trade restrictions (mercantilism) actually impoverish nations by limiting the division of labor

**Limitations:** Smith's framework assumes competitive markets and doesn't fully address power imbalances, externalities, or cases where markets fail. It's a useful map of market-based wealth creation, but not the complete territory of human prosperity.

The practical takeaway: Focus on increasing productive capacity through specialization and voluntary exchange rather than concentrating on monetary aggregates.
